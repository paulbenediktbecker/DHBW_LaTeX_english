In the last years, the Bosch group connected its mobility-, consumer-, and industrial-products with the web to enable smart \ac{IoT} solutions. Now, \ac{AIoT} is the next big transformation the Bosch group has to face. \\
Dong inter alia define \ac{AIoT} as the synergy between \ac{AI} and \ac{IoT} - where the \ac{IoT}-system delivers information to the \ac{AI}-system, which takes over the decision making.\footcite[Cf.][p. 1]{AIoT} This incorporation can enable the Bosch group to develop intelligent connected solutions for improving and automating business processes or discovering new business- and service-models.\\
